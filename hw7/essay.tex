    \large\textbf{Discussion Essay}
\end{center}

\textit{Please write a two-page essay (excluding references) discussing the existing and potential 
ethical issues in the application domain (s) of robotics you are interested in exploring in your 
graduate study and future career.}\\
\vspace{0in}\\
In this essay, I will be exploring the ethical concerns surrounding the advent of autonomous vehicles.
Specifically, I will focus on self-driving vehicles in the civilian space, such as cars, buses, and trucks.
As for a geographical and cultural focus, this essay will mostly take on a perspective encapsulated by 
transportation and traffic sensibilities within the United States of America.\\
\vspace{0in}\\
Just like it is maintained in the V. MÃ¼ller report, this essay aims to focus on problems of ethics where
we do not readily what the answers are~\cite{sep-ethics-ai}, except in the realm of autonomous vehicles. 
There are several such questions in regards to level 5, full driving automation~\cite{SAE-levels} cars, as 
defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers. Such vehicles will not even have steering wheels or 
acceleration/breaking pedals~\cite{synopsys-web-article}!
