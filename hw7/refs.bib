@ARTICLE{Othman2021-xr,
  title     = "Public acceptance and perception of autonomous vehicles: a
               comprehensive review",
  author    = "Othman, Kareem",
  abstract  = "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) or self-driving cars have the
               potential to provide many benefits such as improving mobility
               and reducing the energy and emissions consumed, travel time, and
               vehicle ownership. Thus, in the last few years, both research
               and industry have put significant efforts to develop AVs.
               However, laws and regulations are not ready yet for this switch
               and the legal sector is unable to take the lead but follow the
               development of AVs. Besides, the social acceptance is considered
               as a main key factor for the success of any new technology.
               Despite the enthusiastic speculation of AVs, little is known
               about the public acceptance and perception of the AVs technology
               or the factors that influence the public acceptance. This paper
               reviews the previous studies that focuses on testing the public
               acceptance and perception of AVs and sketches out the main
               trends in this area to provide some directions and
               recommendations for the future. This paper focuses on the
               influence of safety, ethics, liability, regulations, and the
               recent pandemic on the public acceptance of AVs.",
